## Notes

Matt describes charge for advisory board following notes above

 * How far out of the physical sciences do we want to get?
     * Interested in working with data that has a metric linking index to spatial representation
     * Social science data is one example
     * The grant explicitly pulls onto these domains, but we're open to others.
 * Timeline proposed for different disciplines
     * Infrastructural framework (domain context system)
     * Then staggering out the different domain contexts that are implemented
     * Each discipline might have "the one thing to do"
 * Ambassadorial role:
     * Talking with people in their communities
     * Finding out why things didn't work, or did work
 * Timeline
     * What does the timeline look like?  [Original timeline](https://imgur.com/a/yEaPb) from grant, although this will likely change
     * Fields, data standards, formats
     * Project milestones will be updated on GitHub issues
 * Prioritization
     * Most are not familiar enough with the project -- how can we communicate what it does, what it doesn't?
     * One-on-one meetings for instance, or broad code overviews
 * Feedback and evaluations
     * Formal questionairre would work well
     * Most important use case
     * Second most important use case
     * What do you want to do, what can't you do now, how do you do things -- how do you feel about the relevance of various YTEPs on 1..5.
     * Mechanism for providing us information about who on the advisory board is advising us
  * Remote postdocs?  Possible, but not necessarily easy.
  * Geo-referenced data
      * We do have support for some level of GIS data -- spherical (geographic) coordinates, projecting into different map projections.
      * Would like to figure out a more general way of doing that, integrating with mapping packages like cartopy/basemap/etc.
      * Figuring out the visualization and analysis needs are
      * Ideally identify how to be complementary with other packages
 * yt and education
     * What is the current story?  Have tried playing with it a couple times, and it's always too complicated.
     * Funded to work on data carpentry lessons
     * Want to explore ways to make using yt easier (to do a lot less work for instance loading data)
     * "Make it more magical." -- Anthony
