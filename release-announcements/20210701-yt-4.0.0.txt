The yt community is proud to announce the release of yt-4.0!

yt (http://yt-project.org) is an open source, community-developed toolkit for analysis and visualization of volumetric data.

If you are interested in contributing to yt, please see our repository on GitHub at http://github.com/yt-project/yt

This release features a complete reworking of a number of internal components, particularly those related to particles and discrete points.

This release has been years in the making, and features contributions from dozens of individuals, many of whom were new to the project.  It marks the culmination of a set of wide-reaching infrastructure changes that result in much higher fidelity to the underlying data for particle datasets, and we anticipate that improvements to the overall project and project infruastructure will lead directly to a much more rapid release cycle of enhancements and bug fixes in the future.

At the end of this email you can find a non-exhaustive list of individuals who have contributed to this release; many of them made their first contribution during this release!

Binaries for yt 4.0 are available via pip and conda. If you use conda to manage your Python installation, you can update yt via:

$ conda update -c conda-forge yt

Conda-forge package updates may not be up quite yet but should be uploaded by the end of the day.

If you manage your Python installation with pip, you can update yt via:

$ python -m pip install -U yt

For more information, including installation instructions, links to community resources, and information on contributing to yt’s development, please see the yt homepage at https://yt-project.org and the documentation for yt-4.0 at http://yt-project.org/docs/4.0.0

We especially thank Nathan Goldbaum for his many years of work and contributions to this release and to the yt community.

yt is the product of a large community of developers and users and we are extraordinarily grateful for and proud of their contributions. Please forward this announcement on to any interested parties.

Thank you,

The yt team
