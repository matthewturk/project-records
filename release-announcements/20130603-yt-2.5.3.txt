Hi all,

We're proud to release yt version 2.5.3.  This is a scheduled point
release that includes all bug fixes identified and fixed since the
release of 2.5.2 on May 1.

Additions, changes and bug fixes include:

  * yt can now export to RADMC3D
  * Athena frontend now supports Static Mesh Refinement and units (
http://hub.yt-project.org/nb/7l1zua )
  * PlotWindows now have a set_font function and a new default font setting
  * Colorbars less likely to extend off the edge of a PlotWindow
  * Clumps overplotted on PlotWindows are now correctly contoured
  * Allsky projections and HEALpix camera now correctly use four channels (RGBA)
  * Many fixes to light ray and profiles for integrated cosmological analysis
  * Improvements to OpenMP compilation
  * Typo in value for km_per_pc (not used elsewhere in the code base)
has been fixed
  * Enable parallel IPython notebook sessions (
http://hub.yt-project.org/nb/qgn19h )
  * Change (~1e-6) to particle_density deposition, enabling it to be
used by FLASH and other frontends
  * Addition of is_root function for convenience in parallel analysis sessions
  * Additions to Orion particle reader
  * Fix long-standing bug for plotting arrays with range of zero
  * Fixing TotalMass for case when particles not present
  * Fixing the density threshold or HOP and pHOP to match the merger tree
  * Reason can now plot with latest plot window
  * Adding option to have interpolation based on non-uniform bins in
interpolator code
  * Issues with VelocityMagnitude and aliases with velo have been
corrected in the FLASH frontend
  * Halo radii are calculated correctly for domains that do not start at 0,0,0.
  * Halo mass function now works for non-Enzo frontends.
  * Bug fixes for directory creation, typos in docstrings

If you are using the stable branch of yt from an installation script,
you can upgrade using "yt update" or "yt update --all" to upgrade your
full dependency stack.  If you are using the development branch, you
may already have these fixes.  A tarball of this release has been
uploaded to the Python Package Index (PyPI).

This release includes a total of over 150 changesets, contributed over
the course of nearly 40 pull requests by over a dozen individuals.
The next scheduled release will be on July 1, and will be version 2.6.
 We are hoping to include a unification of the Boxlib frontends,
compatibility with Python 3 (and embedding inside Blender) and other
usual improvements to the yt codebase.

Thanks very much,

Matt, on behalf of the yt development team
