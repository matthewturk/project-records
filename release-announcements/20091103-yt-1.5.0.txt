We're proud to announce the release of yt version 1.5, an analysis and
visualization toolkit for Adaptive Mesh Refinement data.  yt features
native support for Enzo (http://lca.ucsd.edu/projects/enzo/) data,
providing a natural and intuitive way to address physical regions in
space as well as processed data.  Version 1.5 features many new
improvements, most prominently that of the addition of parallel
computing abilities and generalization for multiple AMR data formats.
Additional improvements include:

    * Fully rewritten documentation, featuring a new cookbook with
downloadable recipes and commenting facilities
    * Extensive methods section of documentation
    * Fully parallel slices, projections, cutting planes, profiles, quantities
    * Parallel HOP halo finder
    * Friends-of-friends halo finder
    * Object storage and serialization
    * Major performance improvements to the clump finder (factor of five)
    * Generalized domain sizes
    * Generalized field info containers
    * Dark Matter-only simulation support
    * 1D and 2D simulation support
    * Better IO for HDF5 sets
    * Support for the Orion AMR code
    * Spherical re-gridding of data
    * Automated halo profiler and imager
    * Limited non-axially aligned projection support ("disk stacking")
    * Light cone generator
    * Callback interface improved
    * Several new plot overlay callbacks
    * New data objects -- ortho and non-ortho rays, limited ray-tracing
    * Fixed resolution buffers
    * Spectral integrator for CLOUDY data
    * Substantially better interactive interface
    * Performance improvements *everywhere*
    * Command-line interface to *many* common tasks
    * Isolated plot handling, independent of PlotCollections

This release is the product of a year of work by the development team,
and we are very proud of the results and happy with what we have to
offer.  Thanks very much!
