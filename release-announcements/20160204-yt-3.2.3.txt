We are proud to announce the release of yt 3.2.3!

yt (http://yt-project.org) is an open-source, community-developed toolkit for 
analysis and visualization of volumetric data of all types, with a particular
emphasis on astrophysical and nuclear engineering simulations.

Version 3.2.3 is a regularly scheduled bugfix release including fixes for a
number of issues reported since the release of yt 3.2.2.

The changes in this version are summarized below and include a number of 
bugfixes, performance improvements, and documentation improvements. 
We urge all users of prior versions to upgrade to yt 3.2.3 immediately.

Summary of Changes
-----------------------------

Fix an issue with parallel decomposition in the stream frontend under Python3. See PR 1862 and PR 1927

Fix an issue with initializing LightRay objects with both start_position and a redshift range. See PR 1863

Work around an an issue the prevents compiling yt using Python 3.5.0 by disabling OpenMP support. This is fixed in Python 3.5.1. See PR 1871

Fix an issue with parsing some parameters in NMSU ART datasets. See PR 1875

Ensure ARTIO frontend creates a metal_density when outputs contain both Ia and II metal production. See PR 1876

Convert profile extrema to output_units instead of units, to be consistent with behavior of array_like_field. See PR 1882

Only set output_units after units has been set. See PR 1887

Fix casting errors in the SDF frontend under NumPy 1.10 and newer. See PR 1890

Improved Python3 compatibility. See PR 1899, PR 1920, PR 1934, and PR 1931

PlotWindow helpers for showing and hiding colorbars and axis annotations now return the PlotWindow instance. This improves viewing in the notebook. See PR 1905

Corrected error in docstring for load_uniform_grid. See PR 1910

Fix sphinx syntax error in getting help guide. See PR 1928

Improve docs rendering on Firefox for Linux and possible other browsers. See PR 1929

Fix issues parsing GDF files under Python3. See PR 1930

Produce better error message when load_uniform_grid is passed data with an incorrect shape. See PR 1933

Fix issue with plotting cylindrical data. See PR 1940

Fix issues with eps writer docs, rendering, and compatibility. See PR 1941 and PR 1963

Produce a better error message with export_fits is not able to determine any output fields. See PR 1943

Fixed parameter parsing for reduced dimensionality Boxlib datasets. See PR 1947

Fix a number of issues with ds.find_field_values_at_point and ds.find_field_values_at_points. See PR 1950

Adding a cache for selector object hashes. See PR 1965

Import HUGE from yt.utilities.physical_ratiois. See PR 1971

Compatible with upcoming NumPy 1.11 release. See PR 1969

Coming Soon!
-------------------

The next major release of yt will be version 3.3, which is slated to include an overhaul of the volume rendering system, support for analyzing and visualizing unstructured mesh data, a new system for saving and restoring data objects, and a way to specify unit systems when loading data. Some of this functionality is already available on the development branch of yt. We welcome feedback from early testers.

Standard Installation Methods
----------------------------------------

As with previous releases, you can install yt from source using one of the
following methods.

1) From the install script (http://yt-project.org/#getyt ):

If you previously installed yt from the install script, you can update your
installation in-place using the following command:

# Update

$ yt update

If you are on the “stable” branch, updating will bring you from an earlier version 
to 3.2.3, whereas if you are on the development “yt” branch, only the 
changes since your last update should be incorporated.

To install from scratch, do the following:

# Installation

$ wget http://bitbucket.org/yt_analysis/yt/raw/stable/doc/install_script.sh
$ bash install_script.sh

2) From pip (source or binary wheel, see below for more details):

# Installation

$ pip install yt

# Update

$ pip install -U yt

3) From the Anaconda Python Distribution
(https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/):

# Installation

$ conda install yt

# Update

$ conda update yt

Note that it might take up to a week for the conda package built by Continuum
Analytics to be updated for yt 3.2.3.

Installing Binary Packages via pip
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you do not have compilers available, it is also possible to install binary packages (“wheels”) using pip on Windows and Mac OS X (64-bit only for both). This has the advantage of not needing to install yt from source using a proper compiler setup, which has caused occasional problems on both of these platforms and prevented us from installing yt easily on other Python distributions.

Note that it may take several days for binary wheels for yt 3.2.3 to be uploaded.

We have so far been able to install and run the binary distribution via pip on the following platforms and Python stacks:

Windows x86_64:

Enthought Canopy Python (https://www.enthought.com/products/canopy/)
WinPython (http://winpython.sourceforge.net/)

Mac OS X x86_64:

Enthought Canopy Python (https://www.enthought.com/products/canopy/)
Homebrew Python (http://brew.sh/)
Python.org Python
Mac OS X’s system Python
MacPorts Python (https://www.macports.org/)

This is somewhat experimental, so other distributions may work (or not), please submit bug reports or successes to the mailing list or to the Bitbucket issues page (http://bitbucket.org/yt_analysis/yt/issues).

Both Python 2.7 and Python 3.4 are supported. The dependencies for installing yt via this method are the same as from source:

NumPy
h5py
HDF5
SymPy
Matplotlib
IPython (not required, but strongly recommended)

To install a new version of yt on one of these platforms, simply do

$ pip install yt

and you should get the binary distribution automatically. Also, if your python
installation is system-wide (e.g., the Mac system Python) you might need to run pip with administrator privileges.

For more information, including more installation instructions, links to community resources, and information on contributing to yt’s development, please see the yt homepage at http://yt-project.org and the documentation for yt 3.2.3 at http://yt-project.org/doc.

yt is the product of a large community of developers and users and we are extraordinarily grateful for and proud of their contributions. Please forward this announcement on to any interested parties.

As always, if you have any questions, concerns, or run into any trouble updating please don't hesitate to send a message to the mailing list or stop by our IRC channel.

All the best,

Nathan Goldbaum, 
on behalf of the yt development team
