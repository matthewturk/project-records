Hi all,

I've just tagged a "yt-1.6.1" release.  This is primarily a very minor
bug fix release. If you have an installation of yt-1.6 from the
installation script, you should be able to "svn up" and "python2.6
setup.py develop" in the src/yt-1.6 directory to update your version.

The new command "yt instinfo" can provide information about the
currently installed yt version, and in some cases may be able to
automatically update your source with the "-u" option.  This should
allow for self-healing installations, as well as more rapid turnaround
of bug fixes.

This release includes the following items:

Bug fixes:

 * Critical fixes to ParticleIO
 * Halo mass function fixes for comoving coordinates
 * Fixes to halo finding
 * Fixes to the installation script

Improvements:

 * "yt instinfo" command to report current installation information as well as
  auto-update some types of installations
 * Optimizations to the volume renderer (2x-26x reported speedups)

Best wishes,

Matt
