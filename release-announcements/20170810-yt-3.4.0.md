Major Changes and New Features
==============================

-   yt now supports displaying plots using the interactive matplotlib backends. To enable this functionality call `yt.toggle_interactivity()`. This is currently supported at an experimental level, please let us know if you come across issues using it. See [Bitbucket PR 2294](https://bitbucket.org/yt_analysis/yt/pull-requests/2294).
-   The yt configuration file should now be located in a location following the XDG\_CONFIG convention (usually `~/.config/yt/ytrc`) rather than the old default location (usually `~/.yt/config`). You can use `yt config migrate` at the bash command line to migrate your configuration file to the new location. See [Bitbucket PR 2343](https://bitbucket.org/yt_analysis/yt/pull-requests/2343).
-   Added `yt.LinePlot`, a new plotting class for creating 1D plots along lines through a dataset. See [Github PR 1509](https://github.com/yt-project/yt/pull/1509) and [Github PR 1440](https://github.com/yt-project/yt/pull/1440).
-   Added `yt.define_unit` to easily define new units in yt's unit system. See [Bitbucket PR 2485](https://bitbucket.org/yt_analysis/yt/pull-requests/2485).
-   Added `yt.plot_2d`, a wrapper around SlicePlot for plotting 2D datasets. See [Github PR 1476](https://github.com/yt-project/yt/pull/1476).
-   We have restored support for boolean data objects. Boolean objects are data objects that are defined in terms of boolean operations on other data objects. See [Bitbucket PR 2257](https://bitbucket.org/yt_analysis/yt/pull-requests/2257).
-   Datasets now have a `fields` attribute that allows access to fields via a python object. For example, instead of using a tuple field name like `('gas', 'density')`, one can now use `ds.fields.gas.density`. See [Bitbucket PR 2459](https://bitbucket.org/yt_analysis/yt/pull-requests/2459).
-   It is now possible to create a wider variety of data objects via `ds.r`, including rays, fixed resolution rays, points, and images. See [Github PR 1518](https://github.com/yt-project/yt/pull/1518) and [Github PR 1393](https://github.com/yt-project/yt/pull/1393).
-   `add_field` and `ds.add_field` must now be called with a `sampling_type` keyword argument. Possible values are currently `cell` and `particle`. We have also deprecated the `particle_type` keyword argument in favor of `sampling_type='cell'`. For now a `'cell'` `sampling_type` is assumed if `sampling_type` is not specified but in the future `sampling_type` will always need to be specified.
-   Added support for the `Athena++` code. See [Bitbucket PR 2149](https://bitbucket.org/yt_analysis/yt/pull-requests/2149).
-   Added support for the `Enzo-p` code. See [Github PR 1447](https://github.com/yt-project/yt/pull/1447), [Github PR 1443](https://github.com/yt-project/yt/pull/1443) and [Github PR 1439](https://github.com/yt-project/yt/pull/1439).
-   Added support for the `AMReX` code. See [Bitbucket PR 2530](https://bitbucket.org/yt_analysis/yt/pull-requests/2530).
-   Added support for the `openPMD` output format. See [Bitbucket PR 2376](https://bitbucket.org/yt_analysis/yt/pull-requests/2376).
-   Added support for reading face-centered and vertex-centered fields for block AMR codes. See [Bitbucket PR 2575](https://bitbucket.org/yt_analysis/yt/pull-requests/2575).
-   Added support for loading outputs from the Amiga Halo Finder. See [Github PR 1477](https://github.com/yt-project/yt/pull/1477).
-   Added support for particle fields for Boxlib data. See [Bitbucket PR 2510](https://bitbucket.org/yt_analysis/yt/pull-requests/2510) and [Bitbucket PR 2497](https://bitbucket.org/yt_analysis/yt/pull-requests/2497).
-   Added support for custom RAMSES particle fields. See [Github PR 1470](https://github.com/yt-project/yt/pull/1470).
-   Added support for RAMSES-RT data. See [Github PR 1456](https://github.com/yt-project/yt/pull/1456) and [Github PR 1449](https://github.com/yt-project/yt/pull/1449).
-   Added support for Enzo MHDCT fields. See [Github PR 1438](https://github.com/yt-project/yt/pull/1438).
-   Added support for units and particle fields to the GAMER frontend. See [Bitbucket PR 2366](https://bitbucket.org/yt_analysis/yt/pull-requests/2366) and [Bitbucket PR 2408](https://bitbucket.org/yt_analysis/yt/pull-requests/2408).
-   Added support for type 2 Gadget binary outputs. See [Bitbucket PR 2355](https://bitbucket.org/yt_analysis/yt/pull-requests/2355).
-   Added the ability to detect and read double precision Gadget data. See [Bitbucket PR 2537](https://bitbucket.org/yt_analysis/yt/pull-requests/2537).
-   Added the ability to detect and read in big endian Gadget data. See [Github PR 1353](https://github.com/yt-project/yt/pull/1353).
-   Added support for Nyx datasets that do not contain particles. See [Bitbucket PR 2571](https://bitbucket.org/yt_analysis/yt/pull-requests/2571)
-   A number of untested and unmaintained modules have been deprecated and moved to the [yt attic repository](https://github.com/yt-project/yt_attic). This includes the functionality for calculating two point functions, the Sunrise exporter, the star analysis module, and the functionality for calculating halo mass functions. If you are interested in working on restoring the functionality in these modules, we welcome contributions. Please contact us on the mailing list or by opening an issue on GitHub if you have questions.
-   The particle trajectories functionality has been removed from the analysis modules API and added as a method of the `DatasetSeries` object. You can now create a `ParticleTrajectories` object using `ts.particle_trajectories()` where `ts` is a time series of datasets.
-   The `spectral_integrator` analysis module is now available via `yt.fields.xray_emission_fields`. See [Bitbucket PR 2465](https://bitbucket.org/yt_analysis/yt/pull-requests/2465).
-   The `photon_simulator` analysis module has been deprecated in favor of the `pyXSIM` package, available separately from `yt`. See [Bitbucket PR 2441](https://bitbucket.org/yt_analysis/yt/pull-requests/2441).
-   `yt.utilities.fits_image` is now available as `yt.visualization.fits_image`. In addition classes that were in the `yt.utilities.fits_image` namespace are now available in the main `yt` namespace.
-   The `profile.variance` attribute has been deprecated in favor of `profile.standard_deviation`.
-   The `number_of_particles` key no longer needs to be defined when loading data via the stream frontend. See [Github PR 1428](https://github.com/yt-project/yt/pull/1428).
-   The install script now only supports installing via miniconda. We have removed support for compiling python and yt's dependencies from source. See [Github PR 1459](https://github.com/yt-project/yt/pull/1459).
-   Added `plot.set_background_color` for `PlotWindow` and `PhasePlot` plots. This lets users specify a color to fill in the background of a plot instead of the default color, white. See [Bitbucket PR 2513](https://bitbucket.org/yt_analysis/yt/pull-requests/2513).
-   `PlotWindow` plots can now optionally use a right-handed coordinate system. See [Bitbucket PR 2318](https://bitbucket.org/yt_analysis/yt/pull-requests/2318).
-   The isocontour API has been overhauled to make use of units. See [Bitbucket PR 2453](https://bitbucket.org/yt_analysis/yt/pull-requests/2453).
-   `Dataset` instances now have a `checksum` property, which can be accessed via `ds.checksum`. This provides a unique identifier that is guaranteed to be the same from session to session. See [Bitbucket PR 2503](https://bitbucket.org/yt_analysis/yt/pull-requests/2503).
-   Added a `data_source` keyword argument to `OffAxisProjectionPlot`. See [Bitbucket PR 2490](https://bitbucket.org/yt_analysis/yt/pull-requests/2490).
-   Added a `yt download` command-line helper to download test data from <http://yt-project.org/data>. For more information see `yt download --help` at the bash command line. See [Bitbucket PR 2495](https://bitbucket.org/yt_analysis/yt/pull-requests/2495) and [Bitbucket PR 2471](https://bitbucket.org/yt_analysis/yt/pull-requests/2471).
-   Added a `yt upload` command-line helper to upload files to the [yt curldrop](https://docs.hub.yt/services.html#curldrop) at the bash command line. See [Github PR 1471](https://github.com/yt-project/yt/pull/1471).
-   If it's installed, colormaps from the [cmocean package](http://matplotlib.org/cmocean/) will be made available as yt colormaps. See [Bitbucket PR 2439](https://bitbucket.org/yt_analysis/yt/pull-requests/2439).
-   It is now possible to visualize unstructured mesh fields defined on multiple mesh blocks. See [Bitbucket PR 2487](https://bitbucket.org/yt_analysis/yt/pull-requests/2487).
