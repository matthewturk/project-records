The yt community is proud to announce the release of yt 3.3.2!

yt (http://yt-project.org) is an open source, community developed toolkit for the analysis and visualization of volumetric data of all types, with a particular emphasis on astrophysical and nuclear engineering simulations.

yt 3.3.2 is a bugfix release that includes a number of fixes and enhancements for issues discovered after the release of yt 3.3.1. We urge all yt users to update to the latest version.

If your python installation is managed via conda, update following:

$ conda update -c conda-forge yt

If your python installation is managed via pip, update following:

$ pip install -U yt

Finally, if you manage your yt installation by running out of a clone of the yt mercurial repository, update following:

$ yt update
